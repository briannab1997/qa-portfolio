# Heuristic Evaluation — Airbnb Search & Booking Flow

Evaluated using Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.

---

## 1. Visibility of System Status

**Finding:** Loading indicators appear, but are small and easy to miss.  
**Recommendation:** Increase contrast and size to reassure users.

---

## 2. Match Between System & Real World

Clear terminology such as “Where,” “When,” and “Who” aligns with common travel concepts. No major issues.

---

## 3. User Control & Freedom

Removing selected dates requires multiple taps.  
Recommendation: Add a “Clear all” shortcut.

---

## 4. Consistency & Standards

Generally consistent, but CTAs vary between “Reserve,” “Book,” and “Continue.”  
Recommendation: Standardize terminology.

---

## 5. Error Prevention

Guest selector allows invalid combinations.  
Recommendation: Enforce adult requirement.

---

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

Listing cards surface essential info immediately — strong implementation.

---

## 7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use

Keyboard shortcuts not available for desktop users; non-critical but a missed usability opportunity.

---

## 8. Aesthetic & Minimalist Design

Clean, modern UI; however, map clustering and image ratio inconsistencies reduce visual stability.

---

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, Recover from Errors

Empty search behavior is unclear — message is small and lacks guidance.  
Recommendation: Provide a more prominent prompt.

---

## 10. Help & Documentation

Help button is present but buried inside account menu.  
Recommendation: Add contextual help during booking flow.
